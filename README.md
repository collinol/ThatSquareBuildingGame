## Controls

Arrow keys to move up left right and down  
space bar rotates piece  
'q' to place the piece  

time out will drop piece directly down as far as possible.  

Goal: clear pieces by forming a complete 4x4 square or larger  
Don't run out of room

> Note: once you place a piece, a new piece won't spawn unless you try hit an arrow key to move it  
> Yes, it's buggy. I'll get around to fixing it eventually. Not high on my list of priorities tbh
